# This workflow builds on the Module 10 pipeline.
# Key additions:
# 1. 'services' block to run a PostgreSQL container.
# 2. 'env' block in the 'Run tests' step to point pytest to the container.
# 3. The 'pytest tests/' command runs ALL tests in the 'tests' directory.

    # --- THIS IS THE FIX ---
    # We move the 'env' block from the "Run tests" step
    # to the JOB level (right here). This ensures the
    # DATABASE_URL is set before pytest even starts.
